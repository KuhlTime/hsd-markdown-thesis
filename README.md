This template repository should get you quickly up and running with your thesis. It uses [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/) to compile all markdown files into a single PDF. The template is set up for a german üá©üá™ paper but can be easily adapted to other languages.

**The example output can be viewed [here](https://hsd-markdown-thesis.vercel.app/output.pdf).**

I have created this repo because I didn't want to have the complexity of a LaTeX project, but still use most of the features provided by the LaTeX language.

The project includes:
- A GitHub Action that automatically generates a new PDF release every time you push to the `main` branch of this repository.
- Scripts to run the compilation locally.
- Support for BibTex.
- An API to give access to the generated release over a static URL.

The Figma design for the cover (`static/beginning.pdf`) can be found here:<br>

## Folder Structure

- `content/`: The folder where all the **markdown files** and **assets** are stored. It is important that the markdown files are sorted in the same way you want them to appear inside the final PDF file. I suggest you to use a new file for each chapter.
  - `00_meta.md`: This file contains some basic metadata as well as the location of the table of contents, the list of figures and the list of tables. With the `lang` header parameter the document language can be specified.
- `static/`: This directory contains all PDF files that should be added as they are. I have added a basic example PDF File to be used for the HSD.
  - `beginning.pdf`: This file gets prepended to the final PDF.
  - `end.pdf`: The file gets appended to the final PDF.
- `generate.sh`: Script to generate the PDF.
- `watch.sh`: Script that watches the content folder for changes and automatically generates the PDF on any change.
- `content.pdf`: The generated PDF content. The full document is currently only available through GitHub.
- `style.csl`: The citation style used for the PDF. I used a modified version of the IEEE standard üá©üá™. [CSL](https://citationstyles.org/), [CSL Library - GitHub](https://github.com/citation-style-language/styles)
- `bibliography.bib`: This is the BibTex file that holds information about your citations. You can use any BibTex editor you want to generate this file. I have been using [MyBib](https://mybib.com/), which is an easy and beautifully designed web tool. (I am hoping for an API to make the PDF generation even easier.)
- `glossary.tex`: Holds a list of acronyms and abbreviations you can use inside your markdown files. The Syntax for using one can be seen on the [official plugin page](https://github.com/tomncooper/pandoc-gls). `(+<IDENTIFIER>)`

All other files are **not vital** to be known of.

## Edit on Gitpod

Once you created a copy from this template, you can head to [gitpod.io](https://gitpod.io) and create a workspace. All the required steps will be taken for you, and you will be presented with a fresh environment where you can immediately start being productive. All you have to do is to open and drag the `content.pdf` file into a new split pane.

Should the required packages not be installed and there be an error during compilation run:

```shell
sudo apt update && wget https://github.com/jgm/pandoc/releases/download/2.17.1.1/pandoc-2.17.1.1-1-amd64.deb && sudo dpkg -i pandoc-2.17.1.1-1-amd64.deb && rm -rf pandoc-2.17.1.1-1-amd64.deb && sudo apt install texlive-xetex -y && pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

followed by:

```shell
sh ./watch.sh
```

## Setup Local Environment

> ü•≥ If you just want to use the GitHub Action there is **no need to install anything!**

In order to compile the PDF locally you need to have the following installed:
- [pandoc](https://pandoc.org/)
- [when-changed](https://pypi.org/project/when-changed/)

### Font

In order to design your own cover, you need to download the official LaTeX font from: https://sourceforge.net/projects/cm-unicode/

### VSCode

I have added some extensions to go along with VSCode that should help you write more quickly.

### macOS

```sh
brew install pandoc python
```

### Linux (Ubuntu)

```sh
apt update
apt install pandoc python3-pip -y
```

### Windows

```sh
choco install pandoc pip
```

### All

**If** you want to use the `watch.sh` script you can install `when-changed` using:
```sh
pip install when-changed
```

### Execution

To execute the script you can use the following command:
```sh
./watch.sh
```

Or if you only want to run the generation once without listening for changes:
```sh
./generate.sh
```

## Deployment

### GitHub Actions
The GitHub Action will run automatically every time you push your changes to the `main` branch. After a couple of minutes, you will have a new release on your GitHub repository where you can download the generated PDF File.

### API (Optional)

The API provides easy access to the generated PDF File. You can use it to download the PDF File from your browser.

The repository is set up in a way that the API can easily be deployed to a free hosting provider called [Vercel](https://vercel.com/). Visit the Wiki page for more information.

## Cheat Sheet

Pandoc uses a more advanced form of Markdown which allows for LaTeX statements to be directly included in your content. Some of the most useful expressions I have listed in the table below. If you are just looking for a standard markdown cheat sheet you can find it [here](https://guides.github.com/pdfs/markdown-cheatsheet-online.pdf).

| Command                                              | Function                                                                                                      |
|------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `\tableofcontents`                                   | Generates the table of contents based on the markdown headers you have defined.                               |
| `\listoftables`                                      | Creates a list of all tables and their location inside your work.                                             |
| `\listoffigures`                                     | Creates a list of all figures used inside your thesis.                                                        |
| `\setcounter{page}{1}`                               | When using this statement the page counter gets reset and changes all following page numbers.                 |
| `$<Expression>$`                                     | If you want to write a math expression use two `$` to denote the section where your expression is written in. |
| `(+ID)`                                              | Reference a Glossary entry                                                                                    |
| `![Footnote](path/to/image.png){#fig:abc width=50%}` | Load an image and define a reference ID, set image width to 50% of the page width                             |
| `@fig:abc`                                           | Reference an image by its ID                                                                                  |
